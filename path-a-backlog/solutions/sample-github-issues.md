## Issue 1: Customer Alert Threshold Configuration

### Title
```
[US-001] Customer can set custom balance alert threshold
```

### Issue Body

```markdown
## User Story

**As a** retail banking customer  
**I want** to set a custom dollar threshold for low balance alerts  
**So that** I can avoid $35 overdraft fees and proactively manage my cash flow

## Acceptance Criteria

### Positive Scenarios (Happy Path)

```gherkin
Scenario: Customer sets initial alert threshold
  Given I am a logged-in customer with account number "12345678"
  And I have a checking account with current balance "$1,247.83"
  And I have no existing alert threshold configured
  When I navigate to the alert settings page
  And I enter threshold amount "$500.00"
  And I click "Save Threshold"
  Then I see confirmation message "Alert threshold set to $500.00. You'll receive alerts when any account balance drops below this amount."
  And my threshold preference is saved as "$500.00" in the customer profile
  And the threshold takes effect immediately for future balance checks

Scenario: Customer modifies existing threshold
  Given I am a logged-in customer with account number "87654321"
  And I have previously set an alert threshold of "$300.00"
  When I change the threshold to "$750.00"
  And I click "Save Threshold"
  Then I see confirmation message "Alert threshold updated to $750.00"
  And my threshold preference is updated to "$750.00" in the customer profile
  And the new threshold applies to all my accounts immediately
  And the previous threshold "$300.00" is recorded in the audit trail
```

### Negative Scenarios (Error Cases)

```gherkin
Scenario: Customer enters threshold below minimum
  Given I am a logged-in customer on the alert settings page
  When I enter threshold amount "-$50.00"
  And I click "Save Threshold"
  Then I see error message "Threshold must be between $0.01 and $5,000.00"
  And the threshold field is highlighted in red with error styling
  And no threshold value is saved to my customer profile
  And the page remains on the alert settings form

Scenario: Customer enters threshold above maximum
  Given I am a logged-in customer on the alert settings page
  When I enter threshold amount "$10,000.00"
  And I click "Save Threshold"
  Then I see error message "Threshold must be between $0.01 and $5,000.00"
  And my previous threshold value (if any) remains unchanged
  And the system logs the validation error for support review

Scenario: System service unavailable during threshold save
  Given I am a logged-in customer on the alert settings page
  And the Customer Profile Service is temporarily unavailable
  When I enter threshold amount "$500.00"
  And I click "Save Threshold"
  Then I see error message "Unable to save settings. Please try again in a few moments."
  And the system logs error "Profile service timeout - customer 12345678 threshold save failed"
  And my previous threshold setting remains active
  And the form retains my entered value "$500.00" for retry
```

### Edge Cases

```gherkin
Scenario: Customer sets threshold to minimum boundary value
  Given I am a logged-in customer on the alert settings page
  When I enter threshold amount "$0.01"
  And I click "Save Threshold"
  Then I see confirmation message "Alert threshold set to $0.01"
  And I will receive alerts when any account balance reaches or falls below "$0.01"
  And the system handles penny-level precision correctly in future calculations

Scenario: Customer with multiple account types sets threshold
  Given I am a logged-in customer with the following accounts:
    | Account Type | Account Number | Current Balance |
    | Checking     | 12345678       | $1,247.83      |
    | Savings      | 87654321       | $3,456.92      |
    | Checking     | 11111111       | $89.45         |
  When I set alert threshold to "$500.00"
  Then the threshold applies to accounts "12345678", "87654321", and "11111111"
  And I see confirmation "Threshold applies to all 3 eligible accounts"
  And money market and CD accounts are excluded from alert coverage
```

## Risks & Open Questions

### Risks
- **MEDIUM:** Customer Profile Service uses batch updates with 4-hour sync delay, which conflicts with "immediate effect" requirement. Mitigation: Investigate real-time API option or adjust customer expectations.
  
- **LOW:** Multi-account customers may expect per-account thresholds rather than global threshold. Mitigation: Clear messaging in UI about global threshold behavior, plan per-account feature for Phase 2.
  
- **LOW:** $5,000 maximum threshold may be insufficient for high-net-worth customers. Mitigation: Monitor customer feedback post-launch, consider higher limits for premium accounts.

### Open Questions
- [x] **Resolved:** What is the min/max threshold range? **Answer:** $0.01 to $5,000.00 per product team decision
- [x] **Resolved:** Does one threshold apply to all accounts? **Answer:** Yes, global threshold for MVP simplicity
- [ ] **Open:** Should threshold configuration screen display customer's current account balances for context? **Decision needed by:** UX team by end of Sprint 1
- [ ] **Open:** What happens if customer has no eligible accounts for alerts (only CDs/money market)? **Decision needed by:** Business team by Sprint 2 planning

## Issue 2: Email Alert Delivery Implementation

### Title
```
[US-002] Customer receives email alert when account balance drops below threshold
```

### Issue Body

```markdown
## User Story

**As a** retail banking customer  
**I want** to receive email alerts when my account balance drops below my threshold  
**So that** I can transfer funds or modify spending before incurring $35 overdraft fees

## Acceptance Criteria

### Positive Scenarios (Happy Path)

```gherkin
Scenario: Customer receives email alert for checking account threshold crossing
  Given I am customer "john.smith@email.com" with account number "12345678"
  And I have set alert threshold to "$500.00"
  And I have selected "Email only" for alert delivery
  And my checking account balance was "$647.32" at 2:00 PM
  When the core banking system updates my balance to "$423.89" at 2:15 PM
  And the alert processing job runs at 2:16 PM
  Then an email alert is sent to "john.smith@email.com" within 15 minutes
  And the email subject line is "Low Balance Alert - Checking Account xxx5678"
  And the email body contains:
    """
    Your checking account balance has dropped below your alert threshold.
    
    Account: Checking Account xxx5678
    Current Balance: $423.89
    Alert Threshold: $500.00
    Balance Updated: March 15, 2024 at 2:15 PM ET
    
    To avoid overdraft fees, consider transferring funds or monitoring upcoming transactions.
    
    View Account: [Secure Login Link]
    """
  And the email delivery status is logged as "Delivered successfully"

Scenario: Alert deduplication prevents spam for continuing low balance
  Given I am customer with account balance already below threshold
  And I have received an alert for the initial threshold crossing
  When my balance drops further while remaining below threshold
  And the next alert processing cycle runs
  Then no additional email alert is sent (deduplication active)
  And the system logs "Alert suppressed - account still below threshold"
  And I receive a new alert only when balance rises above threshold and then drops below again
```

### Negative Scenarios (Error Cases)

```gherkin
Scenario: Email delivery fails due to invalid email address
  Given I am customer with account "12345678" and threshold "$500.00"
  And my email address in the system is "invalid.email.address"
  And my account balance drops from "$634.22" to "$423.89"
  When the alert system attempts to send email notification
  Then the email delivery fails with error "Invalid recipient address"
  And the system logs delivery failure: "Email bounce - invalid address for customer 12345678"
  And the system retries email delivery after 1 minute, then 5 minutes, then 15 minutes
  And after 3 failed attempts, the delivery is marked as "Permanently failed"
  And the customer alert history shows "Email delivery failed - please update email address"

Scenario: Core banking feed delayed beyond SLA
  Given customers have balances that dropped below thresholds
  And the core banking feed is delayed by 45 minutes (beyond normal 15-minute cycle)
  When the alert processing job runs without new balance data
  Then no alerts are sent for outdated balance information
  And the system logs "Alert processing skipped - stale balance data"
  And alerts are sent in the next cycle when fresh balance data is available
  And customers receive alerts with accurate timing information
```

### Edge Cases

```gherkin
Scenario: Customer balance drops exactly to threshold amount
  Given I am customer with threshold "$500.00"
  And my account balance changes from "$534.67" to exactly "$500.00"
  When the alert processing job runs
  Then an email alert is triggered because balance equals threshold (not just below)
  And the email states "Your balance has reached your alert threshold"
  And the alert text clarifies behavior: "You will be alerted when your balance reaches or falls below your threshold"

Scenario: High volume alert processing during market stress
  Given a market event causes 10,000 customers to cross thresholds simultaneously
  And the notification service rate limit is 100 emails per minute
  When the alert processing job detects all threshold crossings
  Then alerts are queued in timestamp order (first threshold crossing gets priority)
  And customers receive alerts over approximately 100 minutes (fair distribution)
  And no alerts are lost due to volume constraints
  And the system logs "High volume event - estimated delivery completion: [time]"
```

## Issue 3: TCPA Compliance for Alert Time Windows

### Title
```
[US-004] Customer opts in to 24/7 alert delivery for TCPA compliance
```

### Issue Body

```markdown
## User Story

**As a** retail banking customer  
**I want** to opt in to receiving alerts outside normal business hours (9 PM - 8 AM ET)  
**So that** I can receive urgent balance notifications immediately regardless of time while ensuring the bank complies with TCPA regulations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Positive Scenarios (Happy Path)

```gherkin
Scenario: Customer views default TCPA-compliant time window
  Given I am a logged-in customer on the alert settings page
  When I view the notification timing options
  Then I see default setting "Alerts during business hours only (8 AM - 9 PM Eastern Time)"
  And I see explanation "This prevents unwanted alerts during sleep hours per federal TCPA regulations"
  And I see checkbox option "I consent to receive alerts 24/7, including nights and weekends"
  And the 24/7 checkbox is unchecked by default (explicit opt-in required)

Scenario: Customer opts in to 24/7 alert delivery with proper consent
  Given I am a logged-in customer on the alert settings page
  And the 24/7 alert checkbox is currently unchecked
  When I check the box "I consent to receive alerts 24/7, including nights and weekends"
  Then I see expanded TCPA consent language:
    """
    By checking this box, I authorize [Bank Name] to send balance alerts to my mobile phone 
    and email address at any time, day or night, including weekends and holidays. 
    
    I understand:
    • This permission applies to SMS text messages and email alerts
    • I can revoke this permission at any time by returning to this settings page
    • Standard message and data rates may apply for SMS alerts
    • Alerts sent during overnight hours may wake me if my devices are not silenced
    
    I voluntarily provide this consent for urgent account notifications to help me avoid overdraft fees.
    """
  And I must click "I Agree to 24/7 Alerts" button to confirm (cannot save with just checkbox)
  And my consent is logged with timestamp and IP address for TCPA compliance audit

Scenario: Customer revokes 24/7 consent and returns to business hours
  Given I am a customer who previously opted in to 24/7 alerts
  And I am on the alert settings page
  When I uncheck "I consent to receive alerts 24/7"
  And I click "Save Settings"
  Then I see confirmation "Alert delivery returned to business hours only (8 AM - 9 PM ET)"
  And my consent revocation is logged with timestamp for TCPA compliance
  And future alerts outside business hours are queued until 8 AM ET
  And the system displays "Overnight alerts will be delivered at 8 AM the next business day"
```

### Negative Scenarios (Error Cases)

```gherkin
Scenario: Customer attempts to save without completing 24/7 consent process
  Given I am a logged-in customer on the alert settings page
  When I check "I consent to receive alerts 24/7" checkbox
  But I do not click the "I Agree to 24/7 Alerts" confirmation button
  And I click "Save Settings"
  Then I see error message "Please complete the 24/7 alert consent process or uncheck this option"
  And the 24/7 consent is not saved (remains business hours only)
  And the form highlights the incomplete consent section
  And no changes are made to my existing alert settings

Scenario: System fails to log TCPA consent due to audit service unavailable
  Given I am a customer attempting to opt in to 24/7 alerts
  And the Audit Logging Service is temporarily unavailable
  When I complete the 24/7 consent process and click "I Agree to 24/7 Alerts"
  Then I see error message "Unable to process consent at this time. Please try again in a few moments."
  And the 24/7 preference is not saved (consent logging required for TCPA compliance)
  And the system logs "TCPA consent logging failed - blocking preference save for customer 12345678"
  And my existing alert settings remain unchanged
  And the form retains my selections for retry when service is restored
```

### Edge Cases

```gherkin
Scenario: Customer in different time zone opts in to 24/7 alerts
  Given I am a customer located in Pacific Time Zone (3 hours behind Eastern)
  And I opt in to 24/7 alert delivery
  When my account balance drops below threshold at 11 PM PT (2 AM ET)
  Then the alert is sent immediately because I have 24/7 consent
  And the alert timestamp shows both local time "11:00 PM PT" and Eastern time "2:00 AM ET"
  And the system correctly handles time zone conversion for TCPA compliance
  And the consent covers all time zones where the customer might receive alerts

Scenario: Customer opts in during weekend and receives immediate weekend alert
  Given I am a customer who opts in to 24/7 alerts on Saturday at 10 PM ET
  And my account balance drops below threshold on Sunday at 6 AM ET
  When the alert processing job runs
  Then the alert is delivered immediately on Sunday morning
  And the system logs "Weekend alert delivered - 24/7 consent active since [Saturday timestamp]"
  And the delivery complies with TCPA because explicit consent was provided

Scenario: Customer account has joint ownership with different consent preferences
  Given account "88888888" has two account holders:
    | Account Holder | Customer ID | 24/7 Consent | Email Address    |
    | Primary        | 12345678    | Yes          | primary@email.com |
    | Secondary      | 87654321    | No           | secondary@email.com |
  When the account balance drops below threshold at 11 PM ET
  Then an immediate alert is sent to "primary@email.com" (24/7 consent given)
  And the alert for "secondary@email.com" is queued until 8 AM ET (business hours only)
  And each account holder's consent preference is honored independently
  And the audit trail shows different delivery times for the same balance event
```

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Audit Logging Service** - For TCPA consent documentation and compliance record-keeping
  - Critical requirement: 100% reliability for consent logging (blocks save if unavailable)
  - Data retention: Indefinite (TCPA compliance requires long-term record keeping)
  
- **Customer Profile Service API v2.1** - For storing 24/7 consent preference with customer data
  - New field required: tcpa_247_consent (boolean) with consent_timestamp
  - Integration: Existing service, schema update minimal
  
- **Alert Delivery System** - For enforcing time window restrictions during alert processing
  - Integration point: Time window check before alert delivery
  - Dependency: Delivery system must respect individual customer consent preferences

### External Dependencies
- **Legal Team** - Final review and approval of TCPA consent language
  - Status: Initial draft approved, final legal review scheduled for Sprint 1 Week 1
  - Critical requirement: Exact consent language must be legally compliant
  - Contact: Legal Counsel (legal@bank.com)
  - Deliverable: Signed approval of final consent text
  
- **Compliance Team** - Validation of audit trail implementation and data retention
  - Status: Requirements documented, implementation review scheduled
  - Requirements: Complete audit trail for regulatory examination support
  - Contact: Sarah Williams (sarah.williams@bank.com)
  
- **Customer Service Training** - Training on consent preferences and troubleshooting
  - Status: Training materials development scheduled for Sprint 2
  - Requirements: How to help customers understand 24/7 consent implications
  - Contact: Customer Service Manager (cs-training@bank.com)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Risks
- **MEDIUM:** TCPA consent language may require additional legal review, potentially extending timeline by 1-2 weeks
  - Mitigation: Legal team engaged early, backup consent language prepared
  
- **MEDIUM:** Customer confusion about time window implications may increase support calls
  - Mitigation: Clear explanatory text, help documentation, customer service training
  
- **LOW:** Time zone handling complexity may introduce edge case bugs
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing across time zones, use proven time zone libraries
  
- **LOW:** Audit logging service dependency creates single point of failure for consent collection
  - Mitigation: Consent collection blocked if audit logging unavailable (conservative approach)

### Open Questions
- [x] **Resolved:** What is exact TCPA consent language? **Answer:** Legal team provided approved language (see scenarios)
- [x] **Resolved:** How long must consent records be retained? **Answer:** Indefinitely (TCPA violations prosecutable up to 4 years)
- [ ] **Open:** Should consent preference be inherited for new accounts opened by existing customers? **Decision needed by:** Legal and Product teams by Sprint 2 planning
- [ ] **Open:** What happens if customer moves to different time zone - does consent preference follow? **Decision needed by:** Compliance team by Sprint 2
