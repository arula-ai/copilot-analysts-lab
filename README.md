# GitHub Copilot for Business & Systems Analysts - Hands-On Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot for Business & Systems Analysts training lab! This hands-on repository is designed to help Business Analysts, Systems Analysts, Product Owners, and QA/UAT leads learn how to leverage GitHub Copilot to transform raw inputs into well-formed requirements artifacts.

In this 75-minute session, you'll learn practical techniques for using AI-assisted tools to accelerate your requirements documentation work while maintaining quality, compliance, and traceability.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

1. **Generate structured requirements artifacts** - Transform unstructured meeting notes and policy documents into epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria
2. **Apply quality frameworks** - Use INVEST principles, Definition of Ready, and Given/When/Then patterns to ensure artifact quality
3. **Maintain traceability** - Link source documentation through stories to test cases for audit and impact analysis
4. **Leverage AI safely** - Follow security and governance guidelines for using Copilot in regulated environments

## Target Audience

This lab is designed for:
- Business Analysts and Systems Analysts
- Product Owners and Product Managers
- QA/UAT leads and Test Analysts
- Anyone responsible for requirements documentation

**Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with user stories and agile concepts. No coding experience required.

## Session Duration

- **Total Time:** 75 minutes
- **Hands-On Lab:** 40 minutes
- **Format:** Self-paced with two learning paths

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:

- [ ] GitHub Copilot Business/Enterprise license active
- [ ] VS Code or JetBrains IDE installed
- [ ] GitHub Copilot extension installed and enabled
- [ ] Access to this training repository
- [ ] Public Code Filter enabled
- [ ] Markdown preview working in IDE

**Need help?** See [setup/prerequisites.md](setup/prerequisites.md) for detailed checklist.

### Step 2: Complete Setup

Follow the setup guide to configure your environment:

1. Install Copilot extension ‚Üí [setup/copilot-setup.md](setup/copilot-setup.md)
2. Enable Public Code Filter
3. Test that Copilot is working
4. Review security guidelines ‚Üí [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

**Verification:** Ask Copilot to "create a sample user story for customer login." If you get a response, you're ready!

### Step 3: Choose Your Path

This lab offers two paths - choose the one that best matches your daily work:

#### **Path A: Backlog from Meeting Notes** 
*Best for: Product-focused analysts, POs, backlog managers*

Transform messy stakeholder meeting notes into:
- Well-formed epics with business value
- INVEST-compliant user stories
- Gherkin acceptance criteria
- GitHub Issues ready for development

**Time:** 40 minutes hands-on  
**Start here:** [path-a-backlog/README.md](path-a-backlog/README.md)

#### **Path B: Process & Data Documentation**
*Best for: Systems analysts, integration specialists, QA leads*

Transform policy documents into:
- Mermaid flowcharts (basic and swimlane)
- OpenAPI data contracts
- UAT test cases
- Requirements traceability matrices

**Time:** 40 minutes hands-on  
**Start here:** [path-b-process-data/README.md](path-b-process-data/README.md)

**Can't decide?** If you work more with stakeholder conversations and product backlogs, choose Path A. If you work more with technical documentation and system integration, choose Path B.

## Important Guidelines

### Security & Governance

**Before using Copilot on real work:**

1. **Never include PII or sensitive data** in prompts - Always sanitize first
2. **Enable Public Code Filter** - Required for regulated environments  
3. **Verify before committing** - Use [setup/verify-before-commit-checklist.md](setup/verify-before-commit-checklist.md)
4. **Maintain traceability** - Document sources and rationale in commits
5. **Apply professional judgment** - You own the quality, not Copilot

**Read this first:** [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) - Complete security and governance guidelines

### Quality Standards

All Copilot-generated artifacts must meet these criteria:

- **INVEST-compliant** (for user stories)
- **Testable and specific** (acceptance criteria)
- **Traceable to source** (meeting notes, policy docs, requirements)
- **Free of PII** (synthetic data only)
- **Reviewed by you** (professional judgment applied)
